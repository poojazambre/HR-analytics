## Data Visualization - HR Analytics
Developed a dynamic HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, where I initiated the data transformation and cleansing process leveraging DAX and Power Query. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into regional statistics across different countries through intuitive Tree maps. Further, this dashboard takes a deeper dive into the workforce with its multiple charts.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into the workforce, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning. The dashboard is designed to deliver a clear and concise understanding of various HR aspects, from regional statistics to employee sentiments.
